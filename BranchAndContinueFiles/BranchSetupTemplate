Do not use the equal sign in your coments because that is what the program ques on to read.
Our base input units are kilograms, kilometers and seconds. These will be put into our run units in the program. 
The mass of the Sun is 1.989e30 kilograms
The diameter of the sun is 1.391020e6 kilometers
The Universal gravitational constant G is 6.67408e-20 kilometersE3*kilogramsE-1*secondsE-2
Make sure these are the same values stored in the binaryStarCommonDefine.h file!
To get a circular orbit with the same size masses set the same distance r away from the origin 
you need the velosities to be 0.5*sqrt(G*M/r). 
So 0.5*sqrt(G*MassSun) is 1.821726e5 just multiply this by the 1/sqrt(r) to get the a circular velosity.

Branch positions of the stars in kilometers from the origin:

BranchPosition1.x = 3.0e6;
BranchPosition1.y = 0.0;
BranchPosition1.z = 0.0;

BranchPosition2.x = -3.e6;
BranchPosition2.y = 0.0;
BranchPosition2.z = 0.0;

Branch velocities of the stars in kilometers per second:

BranchVelocity1.x =  0.0;
BranchVelocity1.y =  -105.2;
BranchVelocity1.z =  0.0;

BranchVelocity2.x =  0.0;
BranchVelocity2.y =  105.2;
BranchVelocity2.z =  0.0;

The time parameters are in days (24 hour periods):

BranchRunTime = 3.0;

Time when the growth of the star starts.

GrowthStartTime1 = 0.0;

Time when the growth of the star stops.

GrowthStopTime1 = 0.0;

The rate to grow the push back function.

PercentForceIncrease1 = 0.0;

GrowthStartTime2 = 0.0;

Time when the growth of the star stops.

GrowthStopTime2 = 0.0;

The rate to grow the push back function.

PercentForceIncrease2 = 0.0;


The iterations between writing positions and velosities to a file.

RecordRate = 100;

The iterations between displaying the simulation to the sreen.

DrawRate = 10;
